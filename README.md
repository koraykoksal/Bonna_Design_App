# Bonna Design Search App

#### About Project : 
##### The customer can search the design images, save them by adding them to favorites, or contact the sales representative.
##### I wrote a separate backend service for member registration and login operations.
##### I used firebase realtime database and storage for database operations.
##### After registration, an e-mail is sent to the user who becomes a member.
##### The project was made with React Vite package management.
##### The backend service was written with node express.js.
